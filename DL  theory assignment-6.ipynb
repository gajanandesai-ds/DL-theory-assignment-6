    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have several advantages over fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification. Here are some of the main advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter efficiency: CNNs use shared weights and biases for the convolutional layers, which greatly reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected DNNs. This makes CNNs more efficient for processing large images and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation invariance: CNNs are designed to recognize patterns and features within an image regardless of their location, making them translation invariant. This is achieved through the use of convolutional layers that slide filters over the image to detect patterns in a local area. This property makes CNNs well-suited for image classification tasks where the object of interest can be anywhere in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical feature learning: CNNs use multiple layers of feature extraction to learn hierarchical representations of images. This allows the network to learn high-level concepts, such as object categories, from low-level features, such as edges and corners. In contrast, fully connected DNNs treat all input features as independent and do not capture the spatial relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness to input variations: CNNs are designed to be robust to variations in the input, such as changes in lighting, rotation, and scale. This is achieved through the use of techniques such as pooling, which reduces the sensitivity of the network to small changes in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the advantages of CNNs over fully connected DNNs make them the state-of-the-art approach for image classification tasks."

The size of the output tensor for a single image is (200/8)x(300/8)x400x4 = 6,000,000 bytes.
